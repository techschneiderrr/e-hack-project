# Thritfy

## Development
Thrifty is built using Angular.

## Problem 
The main hurdle was to make the UI simple and integrating all the features that will serve the purpose of a blockchain based wallet. As more and more people are getting aware about the blockchain, they are willing to invest and use such technologies. But when we see at numbers not many people are actually doing it. So, whats stopping them, its actually the lack of trust and the complexity of the current technologies. We in our project have tried to over come these certain issues

## 

Install dependencies:

`npm i`

Run during development:

`ng serve --open`
